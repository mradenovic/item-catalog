To run the app, [setup dev environment](../../README.md#setup-dev-environment) first. You should get terminal prompt that looks something like this: `vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-32:~$`. Once connected, run following commands:
* `cd /vagrant/catalog`
* `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `sh init_db.sh`
* `python server.py`
